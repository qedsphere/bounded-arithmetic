\begin{definition}[dWPHP(f)]
    $\exists y<2a \: \forall x<a\; f(x)\ne y$
\end{definition}

\begin{problem}[Crux]
    Is BT $\Sigma_1^b$-conservative over $S^1_2$?
\end{problem}

Note these basic definitions.

\begin{definition}[Conservativity]
    In this case, BT must prove all $\Sigma_1^b$ statements that $S^1_2$ can prove (trivial; BT is defined as $S^1_2+ dWPHP(\Delta^b_1)$). 
    Furthermore BT cannot prove any $\Sigma_1^b$ statements that $S^1_2$ cannot prove. 
\end{definition}


A dual question, likely easier:

\begin{problem}
    Does $S_2^1$ prove the dWPHP for all p-time functions, i.e. $S_2^1=B T$ ?
\end{problem}

Note that the quantifiers of instances of $dWPHP(\Delta_1^b)$ are of $\forall \exists \forall$. However to show nonconservativity we 
consider individual instances with $\exists \forall$ quantifiers that $\Sigma_1^b$ cannot prove. The first statement is more specific, therefore,
perhaps easier to show.
